            <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
            <p>I conducted self-led research by analyzing the existing app and reviewing user reviews on app stores to identify pain points and areas of improvement. Key insights included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Navigation issues:</strong> Users found it hard to quickly find products or categories.</li>
  <li><strong>Cluttered design:</strong> The interface was overwhelming, making it difficult for users to focus on important details.</li>
  <li><strong>Checkout problems:</strong> The checkout process felt complicated, leading to cart abandonment.</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>The intended audience for the Daraz app includes e-commerce shoppers, primarily individuals looking for a convenient, user-friendly online shopping experience. This includes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tech-savvy young adults (18-35 years old):</strong> Who are comfortable navigating mobile apps for shopping.</li>
              <li><strong>Busy professionals:</strong> Who prefer a fast, efficient shopping experience with quick checkout and easy access to product information.</li>
              <li><strong>Frequent online shoppers:</strong> Looking for variety and seamless product discovery.</li>
              <li><strong>Users with different levels of tech experience:</strong> Ensuring the app is intuitive and easy for everyone, from beginners to more experienced online shoppers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The redesign was intended to make shopping more enjoyable, faster, and less overwhelming for all users, with a focus on simplified navigation, clear product presentation, and smooth checkout flow.</p>

            <h2>User Testing Results</h2>
            <p>Although formal user testing was not conducted for this practice project, I performed <strong>informal testing</strong> by reviewing the redesign with a small group of peers and seeking feedback from users who were familiar with the original Daraz app. This feedback provided valuable insights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved Navigation:</strong> Test users found the simplified navigation much easier to use, especially when finding specific categories or products. The clear hierarchy and streamlined layout helped users focus on key tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Checkout Flow:</strong> The new, simplified checkout process received positive feedback for being more intuitive, with fewer steps and clearer options, which is crucial for reducing cart abandonment.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> The minimalist design approach was well-received, with users commenting that the app felt less cluttered and more modern, leading to a more pleasant shopping experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> The mobile version of the app worked seamlessly, with users highlighting how easy it was to browse products and make purchases without glitches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the feedback, it was clear that the redesign addressed many of the key pain points identified during the initial analysis, and it aligned well with the needs of the target audience.</p>
