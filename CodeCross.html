            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>Before starting the redesign, I spent some time exploring the existing CodeCross website to understand its structure, design choices, and user flow. While the site had all the essential information, I noticed a few areas where the overall experience could be simplified. There was an opportunity to bring in more whitespace, create a stronger visual hierarchy, and streamline the navigation for a cleaner, more focused experience. My goal was to build on the foundation that was already there, but present it in a more modern, minimalist, and user-friendly way — especially with responsiveness in mind for mobile users.</p>

            <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>The primary audience for the CodeCross website includes individuals and businesses interested in tech services, particularly those looking for web or software development solutions. This could include startup founders, small to mid-sized business owners, and tech-savvy individuals exploring potential partners. The design needed to communicate professionalism, clarity, and trust — while staying easy to navigate for both technical and non-technical visitors.</p>

            <h2>User Testing Results</h2>

<p>Although formal user testing was not conducted for this practice project, I performed <strong>informal testing</strong> by reviewing the redesign with a small group of peers and seeking feedback from users who were familiar with the original Daraz app. This feedback provided valuable insights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved Navigation:</strong> Test users found the simplified navigation much easier to use, especially when finding specific categories or products. The clear hierarchy and streamlined layout helped users focus on key tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Checkout Flow:</strong> The new, simplified checkout process received positive feedback for being more intuitive, with fewer steps and clearer options, which is crucial for reducing cart abandonment.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> The minimalist design approach was well-received, with users commenting that the app felt less cluttered and more modern, leading to a more pleasant shopping experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> The mobile version of the app worked seamlessly, with users highlighting how easy it was to browse products and make purchases without glitches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the feedback, it was clear that the redesign addressed many of the key pain points identified during the initial analysis, and it aligned well with the needs of the target audience.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The redesign of the CodeCross website allowed me to apply a minimalist design approach aimed at improving the overall user experience. By simplifying the layout, refining the typography, and focusing on key content, I was able to create a more intuitive and modern interface that enhances usability and aligns better with the company’s professional identity. Despite the tight timeline, the project helped me further strengthen my design process and adaptability. Moving forward, I would love to explore additional user feedback to refine the design even more and ensure that the experience truly resonates with the intended audience.</p>
