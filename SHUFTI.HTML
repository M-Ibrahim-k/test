            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The challenge was to rethink Shufti’s login/signup interface—not only improving its UI clarity and professionalism but also integrating three new components: <br>
                “People You May Know,” “Recently Verified Profiles,” and “Suggested Services.” The solution had to retain the feel of a high-trust, secure identity platform while adding context and connection.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                I studied login flows of high-trust platforms like DocuSign, ID.me, and LinkedIn. My goal was to understand how these products introduce new content without distracting from the primary task. 
                I also noted how design choices (like iconography, layout spacing, or color cues) build a sense of security and professionalism in the first few seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                I mapped out user flow pain points in traditional forms and identified opportunities where light, contextual information could actually enhance clarity and comfort—rather than add friction.

            <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>
                This redesign was created for new or returning users who rely on Shufti for secure verification—often in financial, enterprise, or formal environments. 
                These users demand clarity, confidence, and privacy from the very first interaction.

            <p>
                I ran informal feedback sessions with a few design peers and product-minded friends. Their first impressions validated the tone of the layout. 
                They particularly appreciated the subtle layering of new elements without disrupting the login flow. One mentioned, “It feels smart without feeling noisy,” which was exactly the goal.

            <p>
                This project pushed me to think critically about interface balance—how to introduce more functionality without adding more friction. 
                It was less about making it “look good” and more about making it feel secure, intuitive, and gently informative. It’s a great example of micro-innovation inside a standard UX pattern, and I enjoyed building it end-to-end.
