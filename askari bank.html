            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal was to modernize and simplify the mobile banking experience for Askari Bank users. The existing design appeared cluttered and unintuitive, especially for first-time users. This redesign aims to improve usability, visual hierarchy, and accessibility for a smoother banking experience.</p>

            <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
<p>While going through the original Askari Bank app, I noticed that the design felt quite cluttered and heavy. So, I decided to dig deeper by checking user feedback on app stores and forums. Here’s what stood out:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Too much going on:</strong> Screens were packed with information, which made it hard for users to focus on what really mattered.</li>
  <li><strong>No clear flow:</strong> Important actions and info weren’t placed in an order that made sense, so things felt a bit all over the place.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that in mind, I went for a <strong>clean and minimal design</strong> that’s easier on the eyes and helps users get things done without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

            <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
            <p><strong>Primary Users</strong>: Everyday banking customers (ages 20–50) who use the mobile app for balance checks, fund transfers, and bill payments.
            <strong>Secondary Users</strong>: Elderly customers who value clarity, simplicity, and security in digital experiences.</p>

            <h2>User Testing Results</h2>
<p>Since this was a practice project, informal feedback was gathered from peers familiar with mobile banking apps. Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Navigation flow:</strong> Users appreciated the improved navigation structure and logical grouping of features.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual design:</strong> The modern UI and consistent styling made the app feel more trustworthy and easier to use.</li>
  <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear CTAs and better information hierarchy led to faster task completion in the prototype.</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project was an excellent opportunity to explore design improvements for financial apps in Pakistan. It deepened my understanding of how simplicity and clarity play a key role in mobile banking. If given real user data and access to stakeholder feedback, this design could be evolved into a functional concept with measurable impact.</p>
