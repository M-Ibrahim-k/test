            <p>
                UX Designer (Internship) – I was responsible for the entire UX process including understanding business needs, conducting internal research, designing the portal structure, and building wireframes and high-fidelity screens.

            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>
                FFBL needed an internal portal for employees that would simplify access to daily HR tasks, announcements, leave applications, performance records, and internal communication. 
                My job was to create a clean, secure, and user-friendly interface that could be used across departments with varying levels of digital literacy.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                I started by meeting with HR and IT stakeholders to understand the current workflow and bottlenecks. 
                I also conducted informal interviews with 6 employees from different departments to learn how they accessed leave forms, notices, and internal memos.
              </p>
              <p>Key findings:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Employees were using outdated tools like printed forms and shared Excel sheets</li>
                <li>There was no centralized notification system for company-wide announcements</li>
                <li>New users found it hard to navigate the existing intranet system</li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>
                The portal was designed for FFBL employees across departments—ranging from field engineers to administrative officers. 
                Many users were familiar with basic software but not necessarily modern web tools, so the design had to be intuitive, minimal, and accessible even on older devices.

            <h2>User Testing Results</h2>

            <p>
                After designing the initial screens in Figma, I tested them with 3 HR staff members and 2 employees from unrelated departments. Their feedback helped shape the layout:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>“It’s much cleaner than the current system.”</li>
                <li>“I can actually find the leave form in one click now.”</li>
                <li>“Nice to have the latest news right on the dashboard.”</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on this feedback, I made small improvements to text size, icon labeling, and dashboard grouping.

            <p>
                Working on FFBL’s internal portal gave me hands-on experience in designing for enterprise needs. 
                It challenged me to focus on usability for a wide audience while aligning with corporate structure and goals. 
                I learned how to conduct meaningful stakeholder conversations and turn workflows into actionable, simple interfaces. 
                The final prototype was well-received and submitted to the IT department for consideration in future digital transformation efforts.
